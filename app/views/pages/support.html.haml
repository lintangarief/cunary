      %p
        If you think you've found a bug in Cunary, we'd love to hear about it and discuss it with you.
        We handle all bug reports on our GitHub issues page so please head over there and
        submit the bug.
      %p
        If you'd like to request a feature to be added to the core Cunary system, please add an issue on
        GitHub and we'll respond to your request as appropriate. If we believe an issue is worth adding 
        it will be left on the account and potentially assigned a milestone. If we believe your request is
        out of scope and module territory, it will be closed.
      %p
        If you find a security issue, we would rather you didn't post this publicly until we have had
        a chance to issue a fix. If you do come across a sensitive issue, please drop us an email to
        #{mail_to 'security@tryCunary.com'} and we'll look at it right away.
